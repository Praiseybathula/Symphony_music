        <h6>how to choose a Guitar</h6>
        <h6>The Question</h6>
        <p>Students taking their first steps usually approach teachers with the following question: 'is it better to learn on an acoustic or an electric guitar?' The short answer to that question is 'they are different instruments, and your choice should depend on only one thing: which guitar you would like to see yourself playing.'</p>
        <p>There are a number of myths or common misconceptions among starting players, namely that acoustic guitars will make your fingers stronger in the very early stages of practice, nylon stringed guitars can only be used for classical music and electric guitars are easier to play. Though these statements are somewhat based on real facts, they can be misleading and you should not base your choice on them.</p>
        <p>Your first thought when you pick up a guitar should be about the music that you want to do with it. If you choose an instrument thinking it’ll be easier than others you will be in for a surprise: even the first steps in guitar playing demand practice time: your fingers will probably get sore when playing either acoustic or electric and you’ll soon come to face technical challenges when practicing a simple tune. </p>
        <p>So the main factor in choosing what type of guitar you’ll be playing is the music you want to make with it. It all comes down to what attracts you and motivates you to play, and you should really pick an instrument that you will look forward to practice with. Consider the music you listen to and you’d like to play and make a choice that won’t leave you stuck with the wrong type of guitar.</p>

        <h6>Parts of the Guitar</h6>
        <p>Below we offer diagrams of both acoustic and electric instruments and their most commonly mentioned parts. Some items are, of course, common to both types of instruments (headstock, tuners, fretboard, strings, etc.) Cases such as those are not repeated. </p>
        <p>Strings: although traditional guitars employs six strings, there are guitar variations that can use up to fourteen strings,</p>
        <p>Neck:  roughly, the piece of wood that extends from the body of the instrument, where the fretboard, frets, and headstock are placed.</p>
        <p>Headstock: it is the part of the instrument that holds the strings and, usually, those are fixed to the headstock by means of tuning pegs. Each major guitar brand has a number of signature headstocks that make their instruments easily recognizable. </p>

        <h6>Accesories</h6>
        <p>Picks -or plectra- are basically small, flat pieces of plastic employed to strum or pluck the strings. Guitarists playing rock, jazz, and derived genres employ picks more often than those coming from the classical tradition, who play with their fingers. This is by no means a rule, however, as modern guitar technique evolves rapidly, and nowadays a number of hybrid techniques are used by some players.

            Picks are usually made of plastic -though other materials may be found, especially in non-guitar picks- and cut in a triangle shape with rounded corners. Pick manufacturers usually print their logo and the thickness of the plastic, which is an important factor in terms of control and precision. Heavy picks usually yield better results, with a more defined attack, and a greater capacity for speed playing (they are less prone to bending). They require more practice to be mastered, however, so its usually recommended that beginners start with thin picks (which as a matter of fact are always good for strumming, because of the particular clicking they emit against the strings).</p>
